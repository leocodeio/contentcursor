# Spectral  
### “Focus on creating — let us handle the rest.”

## 🧭 Overview

**Spectral** is a creator–editor collaboration and content management platform designed to **streamline the YouTube production pipeline**.  
It replaces scattered tools like Google Drive, WhatsApp, Frame.io, and manual uploads with one integrated workspace that manages **content storage, version control, communication, approvals, and publishing** — all in one place.

---

## 🎬 The Problem (Without Spectral)

In the traditional workflow:
1. **Creator uploads** raw content to shared storage (e.g., Google Drive).  
2. **Editor downloads** files, edits locally, and re-uploads to Drive.  
3. **Creator reviews** the edits (via comments, WhatsApp, or Frame.io).  
4. If changes are needed → repeat the cycle.  
5. Once approved, **creator manually uploads** to YouTube via Studio.

This process causes:
- Fragmented communication.  
- Confusing file management and lost versions.  
- Wasted time due to re-uploads and manual transfers.  
- Delayed publishing and tracking issues.

## ⚡ The Solution (With Spectral)

Spectral introduces an **end-to-end intelligent workspace** where creators and editors work seamlessly inside one system.

### Workflow with Spectral:
1. **Creator uploads raw content** directly into Spectral storage.  
2. **Editor accesses files**, performs edits, and **uploads a version (v1, v2, etc.)** back into Spectral.  
3. **Creator reviews the version** and approves or requests changes — all within the platform.  
4. Once a version is approved, **Spectral automatically uploads** the final video to the creator’s YouTube channel via secure API.  
5. **Communication, version tracking, and approvals** are centralized in Spectral — no external tools required.
