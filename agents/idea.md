# Project Idea: ContentCursor 🦁

## Vision
ContentCursor is a Next.js 15 SaaS boilerplate designed for rapid content management and automation. It bridges the gap between creative content (YouTube) and structured storage (Google Drive), providing a monolithic API to handle the heavy lifting.

## Core Features
1. **Google Drive Automation**: 
   - Automated folder structure for projects.
   - High-speed multipart uploads and cloud storage management.
2. **YouTube Integration**:
   - Seamlessly fetch and manage YouTube metadata.
   - Connect video assets with project folders in Drive.
3. **Modular API Architecture**:
   - Clean, service-based backend logic (`src/server/services`).
   - Type-safe API routes using Zod and Better Auth.
4. **Developer-First Stack**:
   - Next.js 15 (App Router), Prisma (MongoDB), Bun, and i18n support.

## Landing Page Strategy
- **Hero**: Highlight "Automation for Content Creators."
- **Features**: Focus on Drive sync, YouTube metadata, and the developer-friendly boilerplate.
- **Vibe**: Fast, clean, and productivity-oriented.
